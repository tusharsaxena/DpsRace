-- core/WidgetsSetup.lua — NS.MakeDropdown / NS.CloseMenu / NS.MakeTestStrip / NS.ShowCopy from
-- LibKa0s-Widgets-1.0: the Results window's filter-bar dropdowns (modules/Results_Runs.lua, and
-- modules/Results_Insights.lua from N4 of the #12 plan), the test-mode strip a window lays over data that is not the player's,
-- and the copy window the run detail's talent loadout opens (modules/Results_Loadout.lua).
--
-- A seam, nothing else (library-stack-§7): one file leases the major, so the art the dropdown draws
-- is resolved once, here. The library is vendored and cannot know which folder it was copied into,
-- so the chevron and the tick arrive as resolved paths from the addon's own media seam
-- (core/MediaSetup.lua); NS.Icon answering nil is a real answer, and the library falls back to the
-- Blizzard chevron and tick. No option this addon builds carries a glyph, so no glyph face is passed.
--
-- THE POPUP IS A PROCESS-WIDE SINGLETON parented to UIParent, so hiding a window does not reach it.
-- Every non-click close path of a window with a dropdown calls NS.CloseMenu(): the Results window's
-- OnHide (also the Escape path through UISpecialFrames) and its tab switch.
--
-- DEGRADED (the library absent): NS.MakeDropdown answers nil and the filter bar draws no dropdown at
-- all rather than a dead control that opens no menu; the filters stay at "all". NS.MakeTestStrip
-- answers nil; NS.CloseMenu is a no-op, because there is no menu that could be open; NS.ShowCopy
-- answers false and its caller prints the text instead.
