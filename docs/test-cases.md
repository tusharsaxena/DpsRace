# Test Cases

The full inventory of every headless test case in this repo, grouped by the suite file it
lives in. The `## Totals` table below counts the cases that run: its **Total** is the
authoritative pass count, and the README test badge and any count quoted in the docs must equal
it. A declared skip is listed by name in its group and counted on the `Skipped` row, never in
Total.

**Generated — do not hand-edit.** Regenerate with `lua tests/run.lua --list > docs/test-cases.md`.

### test_schema.lua (14)

- schema: the load-time shape check finds no error and every stored path resolves
- schema: Master controls carries exactly the rows this addon has state for, in order
- schema: the Enable row is labeled with the brand
- schema: every row has a group, a label and a page
- schema: a write goes through the seam, reacts, and announces SETTINGS_CHANGED once
- schema: an unknown path is refused and stores nothing
- schema: the Minimap row reads SHOWN and stores LibDBIcon's inverted `hide`
- schema: Reset all settings is a profile reset and never touches the Minimap button
- schema: Test mode is a session-only checkbox over the preview
- schema: entering combat ends test mode, and says so once
- schema: General visibility changes the registration set while enabled
- schema: a migration runs once and stamps the stored version
- panel: the category registers eagerly and every page body renders on first show
- panel: the landing page is the library's, with the logo and one row per verb

### test_slash.lua (13)

- slash: bare /dr opens the settings panel
- slash: `options` is the legacy spelling of `config`
- slash: help lists every COMMANDS verb, in order
- slash: the landing page's rows come from the same table
- slash: disable and enable write the `enabled` row through the seam and echo it
- slash: `debug on`/`off` flip the session flag; bare `debug` toggles only the window
- slash: `perf` is the host's verb and prints the harness's lines
- slash: the schema CLI reads and writes through the seam

- slash: the stub's refusal format is byte-equal to the live library's
- slash: library absent, /dr still answers, and enable/disable still land

- bindings: a key press runs the same toggle the menu does
- bindings: Bindings.xml names exactly the two buttons, with no default key

### test_disabled.lua (13)

- Disabled 1: enabled, the addon registers something and shows something at all

- Disabled 2+3 (degraded): a module's bus receiver goes at stand-down and comes back
- Disabled 4: no timer, ticker or OnUpdate is left armed, and none re-arms
- Disabled 5: every display that was shown is hidden, refused at the source
- Disabled 6: every event fired anyway writes nothing, prints nothing, shows nothing

- Disabled 9: re-enabling restores the set FROM CURRENT STATE, not a snapshot
- Disabled 10: releasing ONE hold does not resurrect an addon the other holds down

### test_perf_harness.lua (4)

- perf: the descriptor declares the buckets, the SavedVariable and the one latch

- perf: suspend takes the perf hold and the addon is inert; resume restores it

### test_loadorder.lua (3)

### test_prose.lua (15)

- prose: the gate carries localization-§5's two lists whole, and nothing of its own
- prose self-test: the carve-out suppresses the named generated folder, and only it
- prose self-test: a path the carve-out does not name is not covered by one that looks like it
- prose self-test: a carve-out that is not a set of path strings is a failure, not a silence
- prose self-test: a TOC's file lines are read as paths, and its directives and comments are not
- prose self-test: a .pkgmeta's ignore block is read, and the keys around it are not
- prose self-test: an ignore entry covers a path exactly, by folder, and by wildcard
- prose self-test: the carve-out admits a generated dump and refuses a file the TOC loads
- prose self-test: a waiver-file exclusion meets the same two refusals as the carve-out
- prose self-test: each list is refused on the matching rule its own scan uses
- prose self-test: the scan and the refusals read the added exclusions through one reader
- prose self-test: a narrowing is refused by what it suppresses, not by how it is written
- prose self-test: the disclosure names what each entry suppressed, and says when it is bounded
- prose self-test: a malformed waived is a failure, not a silence

### test_layout_cap.lua (13)

- layoutcap self-test: an over-cap file missing from the census is reported, and an exempt one is not
- layoutcap self-test: a census row that outlives its breach is reported
- layoutcap self-test: an over-cap row that names no terminal state is reported
- layoutcap self-test: the census and the exempt set are held to naming the same paths

### test_diagnostics_contract.lua (9)

- diagnostics contract: both forms run the report
- diagnostics contract: the debug word is matched in any case
- diagnostics contract: both markers carry the brand and the end counts the report
- diagnostics contract: the report appends after what the console already holds
- diagnostics contract: the report lands with logging off and turns it on for the session
- diagnostics contract: an addon that opts out lands the report and leaves logging off (skipped: this addon keeps the default (Kit.diagnostics.enablesLogging is not false), so its report turns logging on; the case above holds it)
- diagnostics contract: with logging already on, the report writes no second enable line
- diagnostics contract: both forms run while the addon is disabled
- diagnostics contract: no other name runs the report

### test_lizard_sighted.lua (8)
